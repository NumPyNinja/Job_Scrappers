The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.
We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is truly saying.
We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.

Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants.

This role is an in-house mathematician role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.

The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.

Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.

We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.

Requirements:
Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis.
Excellent graduate-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths.
Strong intuition to guide the design of reasonable conjectures from the geometry of the problem and background knowledge prior to attempting any proof.
No finance or machine learning experience is required."

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as a lead architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together than in optimizing that routine. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and capture an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there. We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other, and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, then those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
Most of our agents are now open source, so being comfortable working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
Clear writing is a must (see above), but sometimes electronic conversations can get a little “hot”. Your job is to help surface the important issues and drive them to resolution.
As a lead architect, you will be working as a partner with (and reporting to) our VP of Engineering. As a member of the group's engineering leadership team, they will be relying on you to help them formulate their technical roadmap and assist their teams. You will guide the other architects in the group and help coordinate work so that our architects and staff engineers are working on the highest priority issues.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as an architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and gain an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there.
We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Most of our agents are now open source, so comfort working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
You will help surface important issues and drive them to resolution.
As an architect, you will be working closely with our Instrumentation leadership team. They will be relying on you to help them formulate the technical roadmap and assist teams.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems.
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with Open Instrumentation and/or OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as an architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and gain an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there.
We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Most of our agents are now open source, so comfort working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
You will help surface important issues and drive them to resolution.
As an architect, you will be working closely with our Instrumentation leadership team. They will be relying on you to help them formulate the technical roadmap and assist teams.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems.
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with Open Instrumentation and/or OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as a lead architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together than in optimizing that routine. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and capture an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there. We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other, and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, then those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
Most of our agents are now open source, so being comfortable working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
Clear writing is a must (see above), but sometimes electronic conversations can get a little “hot”. Your job is to help surface the important issues and drive them to resolution.
As a lead architect, you will be working as a partner with (and reporting to) our VP of Engineering. As a member of the group's engineering leadership team, they will be relying on you to help them formulate their technical roadmap and assist their teams. You will guide the other architects in the group and help coordinate work so that our architects and staff engineers are working on the highest priority issues.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

A timely question for our group is how to prepare future HPC and data center systems given the expectation of many heterogeneous computing resources, and the continued need for higher performance efficiency to reach the next milestone after exascale computing. CAG is investigating related topics as well, such as specialized hardware accelerators, micro-architectural enhancements, new devices to replace existing CMOS transistors, emerging memories, 3D, and photonics.

These challenges have motivated the research in the Photonic Integrated Networked Energy efficient datacenter (PINE) project. The PINE architecture addresses the data movement challenge by leveraging the unique properties of photonics to steer bandwidth to where it is needed rather than over-provisioning network resources, which significantly increases energy consumption. Photonics can also be used to efficiently perform resource disaggregation which includes advanced photonic link technology, Photonic Multichip modules, and optical circuit switches to dynamically reconfigure/aggregate resources to meet the needs of diverse workloads.

We are seeking a Postdoctoral Fellow for Advanced Optical Interconnects in Datacenters to participate primarily in system-level architectural studies using models of emerging photonic components. In particular, the focus of this position is to design novel ways for resource disaggregation and network reconfiguration at every level (node to system) to best serve HPC and datacenter applications and take advantage of the unique strengths of optical switches and links. This project requires expertise in networks and computer architecture. The successful candidate will also have opportunities to participate in exciting projects in related fields, such as in micro-architectural research towards improving performance of critical HPC and datacenter applications.

We value and strive for diversity in backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.

What You Will Do:
Design and implement a multi-scale modeling and simulation environment to model the impact of a wide range of ideas in computer networks and architecture.
Capture communication and computation traces from important HPC and datacenter applications using CPUs and GPUs to guide this study.
Work closely with the developers of emerging optical components such as switches for incorporation into the simulation framework, including developers of other relevant technologies. Provide feedback and suggestions to those developers on how to improve their components to better fit HPC and data center systems.
Use demonstrated expertise in networks and computer architecture to design a novel approach to resource disaggregation and network reconfiguration in all system levels that includes the reconfiguration algorithm, physical topology limitations, topology construction, routing, adapting to different optimization goals, impact to the applications, etc.
Collaborate with algorithm and software developers for the purpose of making results of research easily accessible to them.
Participate in all requested assignments, including research, preparation of funding proposals, documentation of results and reporting results to sponsors.
Establish research directions and pursue funding opportunities.

What is Required:
PhD in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Computational Science, Mechanical Engineering, Physics or a related discipline.
Understanding of devices and their models, 3D integration, emerging memory technologies, and architecture specialization (e.g., accelerators).
Demonstrated expertise in working with modeling and simulation methods and software tools for hardware exploration.
Demonstrated expertise in setting research direction and priorities for future computing architectures or network architectures.
Demonstrated expertise in Verilog, C++, Python.
Familiarity with HPC and datacenter applications.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills.
Demonstrated ability to work effectively as part of a cross-disciplinary team.

Desired Qualifications:
Demonstrated expertise in photonic systems.
Demonstrated expertise in HPC or datacenter applications.
Demonstrated expertise in Scala.
Understanding of programming models popular in HPC and datacenters.
For full consideration, please apply by October 29, 2020.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as an architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and gain an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there.
We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Most of our agents are now open source, so comfort working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
You will help surface important issues and drive them to resolution.
As an architect, you will be working closely with our Instrumentation leadership team. They will be relying on you to help them formulate the technical roadmap and assist teams.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems.
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with Open Instrumentation and/or OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as an architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and gain an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there.
We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Most of our agents are now open source, so comfort working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
You will help surface important issues and drive them to resolution.
As an architect, you will be working closely with our Instrumentation leadership team. They will be relying on you to help them formulate the technical roadmap and assist teams.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems.
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with Open Instrumentation and/or OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as a lead architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together than in optimizing that routine. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and capture an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there. We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other, and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, then those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
Most of our agents are now open source, so being comfortable working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
Clear writing is a must (see above), but sometimes electronic conversations can get a little “hot”. Your job is to help surface the important issues and drive them to resolution.
As a lead architect, you will be working as a partner with (and reporting to) our VP of Engineering. As a member of the group's engineering leadership team, they will be relying on you to help them formulate their technical roadmap and assist their teams. You will guide the other architects in the group and help coordinate work so that our architects and staff engineers are working on the highest priority issues.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as a lead architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together than in optimizing that routine. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and capture an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there. We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other, and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, then those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
Most of our agents are now open source, so being comfortable working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
Clear writing is a must (see above), but sometimes electronic conversations can get a little “hot”. Your job is to help surface the important issues and drive them to resolution.
As a lead architect, you will be working as a partner with (and reporting to) our VP of Engineering. As a member of the group's engineering leadership team, they will be relying on you to help them formulate their technical roadmap and assist their teams. You will guide the other architects in the group and help coordinate work so that our architects and staff engineers are working on the highest priority issues.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Work/Life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. Most days, our entire team is co-located in the Seattle office, but we’re also flexible when people occasionally need to work from home. However, now a days the entire team is working from home due to covid-19. We generally keep core in-office hours from 10am to 4pm. About half of us come in earlier and the other half of us stay later.
On-Call Responsibility
This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.
Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new team members. Our team has a broad mix of experience levels and Amazon tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior engineers truly enjoy mentoring more junior engineers and engineers from non-traditional backgrounds through one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth. We try to assign projects and tasks based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.
Inclusive Team Culture
Our team is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds. Yes we do get to build a really cool service, but we also think a big reason for that is the inclusive and welcoming culture we try to cultivate every day. We’re looking for a new teammate who is enthusiastic, empathetic, curious, motivated, reliable, and able to work effectively with a diverse team of peers; someone who will help us amplify the positive & inclusive team culture we’ve been building.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as an architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and gain an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there.
We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Most of our agents are now open source, so comfort working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
You will help surface important issues and drive them to resolution.
As an architect, you will be working closely with our Instrumentation leadership team. They will be relying on you to help them formulate the technical roadmap and assist teams.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems.
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with Open Instrumentation and/or OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as a lead architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together than in optimizing that routine. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and capture an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there. We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other, and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, then those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
Most of our agents are now open source, so being comfortable working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
Clear writing is a must (see above), but sometimes electronic conversations can get a little “hot”. Your job is to help surface the important issues and drive them to resolution.
As a lead architect, you will be working as a partner with (and reporting to) our VP of Engineering. As a member of the group's engineering leadership team, they will be relying on you to help them formulate their technical roadmap and assist their teams. You will guide the other architects in the group and help coordinate work so that our architects and staff engineers are working on the highest priority issues.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as a lead architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together than in optimizing that routine. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and capture an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there. We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other, and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, then those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
Most of our agents are now open source, so being comfortable working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
Clear writing is a must (see above), but sometimes electronic conversations can get a little “hot”. Your job is to help surface the important issues and drive them to resolution.
As a lead architect, you will be working as a partner with (and reporting to) our VP of Engineering. As a member of the group's engineering leadership team, they will be relying on you to help them formulate their technical roadmap and assist their teams. You will guide the other architects in the group and help coordinate work so that our architects and staff engineers are working on the highest priority issues.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as a lead architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together than in optimizing that routine. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and capture an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there. We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other, and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, then those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
Most of our agents are now open source, so being comfortable working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
Clear writing is a must (see above), but sometimes electronic conversations can get a little “hot”. Your job is to help surface the important issues and drive them to resolution.
As a lead architect, you will be working as a partner with (and reporting to) our VP of Engineering. As a member of the group's engineering leadership team, they will be relying on you to help them formulate their technical roadmap and assist their teams. You will guide the other architects in the group and help coordinate work so that our architects and staff engineers are working on the highest priority issues.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as an architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and gain an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there.
We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Most of our agents are now open source, so comfort working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
You will help surface important issues and drive them to resolution.
As an architect, you will be working closely with our Instrumentation leadership team. They will be relying on you to help them formulate the technical roadmap and assist teams.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems.
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with Open Instrumentation and/or OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Culture
We’re not just engineering systems, we’re engineering a company. We hold ourselves accountable to achieving our vision: delivering success for our customers and meaningful experiences for our people.
Blaze Your Own Trail: We’re at an exciting stage—we have an established customer base and big growth plans. There are unprecedented opportunities to learn and lead right away. Whatever your goals, from heads-down development to collaborating with customers, from executing and streamlining our business to leading teams, from innovating new products to opening up new industries, or a bit of “all of the above"", we’ll work together to get you there. There is no one path. You’ll have the freedom to follow your interests as they evolve.
Solve Hard Problems: The engineering we do is complex—thousands of globally distributed components, vast amounts of fast-moving shared data, continuous real-time analysis and execution, always-on mission-critical performance. It ordinarily takes years to solve these problems (think aerospace or flight control) but that’s not an option for us. Our fintech executes hundreds of billions of dollars in trades each day, so there’s huge value in launching ideas fast. We invent smarter designs and smarter ways to develop and test, so we can innovate in quick cycles without compromising the exacting requirements inherent to the systems we build.
Be Greater Together: We tackle problems no one could solve alone, so we’re here to learn from each other. Each insight is a springboard for the next. We encourage disagreement to achieve a greater outcome. But solving hard problems is only part of the equation—we hire people who inspire us and enjoy working together. The result is a team that truly “clicks”.
Do the Right Thing: Building a healthy, lasting company starts from the inside out. Our progressive policies and practices foster transparency, integrity, openness, and forward thinking. We are deeply committed to building a company that empowers people, enables them to thrive throughout their careers, and do big things here.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as a lead architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together than in optimizing that routine. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and capture an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there. We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other, and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, then those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
Most of our agents are now open source, so being comfortable working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
Clear writing is a must (see above), but sometimes electronic conversations can get a little “hot”. Your job is to help surface the important issues and drive them to resolution.
As a lead architect, you will be working as a partner with (and reporting to) our VP of Engineering. As a member of the group's engineering leadership team, they will be relying on you to help them formulate their technical roadmap and assist their teams. You will guide the other architects in the group and help coordinate work so that our architects and staff engineers are working on the highest priority issues.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as a lead architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together than in optimizing that routine. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and capture an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there. We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other, and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, then those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
Most of our agents are now open source, so being comfortable working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
Clear writing is a must (see above), but sometimes electronic conversations can get a little “hot”. Your job is to help surface the important issues and drive them to resolution.
As a lead architect, you will be working as a partner with (and reporting to) our VP of Engineering. As a member of the group's engineering leadership team, they will be relying on you to help them formulate their technical roadmap and assist their teams. You will guide the other architects in the group and help coordinate work so that our architects and staff engineers are working on the highest priority issues.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as an architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and gain an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there.
We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Most of our agents are now open source, so comfort working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
You will help surface important issues and drive them to resolution.
As an architect, you will be working closely with our Instrumentation leadership team. They will be relying on you to help them formulate the technical roadmap and assist teams.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems.
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with Open Instrumentation and/or OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as a lead architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together than in optimizing that routine. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and capture an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there. We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other, and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, then those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
Most of our agents are now open source, so being comfortable working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
Clear writing is a must (see above), but sometimes electronic conversations can get a little “hot”. Your job is to help surface the important issues and drive them to resolution.
As a lead architect, you will be working as a partner with (and reporting to) our VP of Engineering. As a member of the group's engineering leadership team, they will be relying on you to help them formulate their technical roadmap and assist their teams. You will guide the other architects in the group and help coordinate work so that our architects and staff engineers are working on the highest priority issues.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

You’ll be working as part of a skilled, collaborative, and passionate team to jointly design and implement Xometry’s platform.

Our Technology team values diversity, inclusion, and personal growth. We believe that great tech skills paired with behaviors and values make for a great culture that support growth and personal achievement. You will be a good fit for this role if you believe the following is true for you.

Foundational Traits / Responsibilities of Everybody
There are certain things that are simply requirements of being a good employee, coworker, and teammate. These things are so critical to how we operate that if you're not doing some of these well there isn't much value in focus other parts of your career...these must always come first. Only once you do these things on a daily basis can you focus on growing your career.

Core Professionalism
Be Respectful and Kind to Everyone - Nobody should be treated differently than anyone else, regardless of their role, job level, background, or absolutely anything else. Treat each other with respect, dignity, and courtesy. Assume good intent always.
Be Available - Be available online (or in office if applicable) during the times that are aligned to the company and your specific team and when your team is operating.
When You Need Help, Ask for It - We trust each other to do a great job at all times, and shy far away from micromanaging everyone's tasks. With that comes responsibility to not waste time if you're stuck or having trouble. Raise your hand, reach out to a teammate, say something in #slack, or jump on a Zoom. No one will judge you for asking for help.

Being a Team Player
Participate in Team Ceremonies - Always participate in the things the rest of your team is participating in. If you think certain meetings or activities aren't productive, voice that opinion, but never opt-out of participating with your team.
Follow Team Practices & Guidelines - Whether it's coding practices, ticket creation standards, code reviews, quality bars, or any other standards followed by the team, they exist for a reason, follow them. If you don't agree or think things could be better, say something. Part of being the best means always evolving and constantly trying to get better, which means we have to keep asking ourselves if things can be better.
Strive To Be Better - One of the coolest things about Xometry is that we never assume we're doing the best we can and are always open for improvement. We want everyone at Xometry to feel the same way. So, whether it's you trying to figure out ways to grow your career or accomplish your career goals, or whether it's little things to make our products or practices a little bit better, keep questioning the status quo and always try to be better every day.

Working on the Technology Team
We expect that every person in technology at all levels brings with them a foundation of technical skills. We focus less on specific languages and more on your knowledge and experience with technology. We will meet you where you are and then help you to grow from there. Our platform technology is a mix of Front-End, Back-End, and Data.
What You'll Do & What You'll Bring
Active participation on a software development team designing, coding, testing, and releasing functionality to our customers
Close collaboration with other engineers and product managers to become a valued member of an autonomous, cross-functional team
Operational responsibility for the services that are owned by your team, potentially including taking part in an on-call rotation
Experience working on a web application project that you can talk about, showing off some of your work
Some understanding and experience (more depending on level) with front-end technologies HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, Ajax and any of the common frameworks like React, Angular, Ember, Backbone, …etc (really any javascript based framework)
Some understanding and experience (more depending on level) with using using C#, Java, C, C++, Ruby, Python, Node or similar back-end technologies
Familiarity with code management (GIT) and continuous integration build and deploy
A Few Requirements
Must be a US citizen, green card holder, or a legal permanent resident of the United States
Excellent oral and written (English) communication skills
Must be able to work core aligned hours to US Eastern Time / GMT-5

Competitive salary + comprehensive benefits
Flexible working hours with paid time off
Health, Dental, Vision, Commuter, Dependent Care, Primary & Secondary Parental Leave, and 401K benefit options

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as a lead architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together than in optimizing that routine. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and capture an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there. We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other, and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, then those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
Most of our agents are now open source, so being comfortable working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
Clear writing is a must (see above), but sometimes electronic conversations can get a little “hot”. Your job is to help surface the important issues and drive them to resolution.
As a lead architect, you will be working as a partner with (and reporting to) our VP of Engineering. As a member of the group's engineering leadership team, they will be relying on you to help them formulate their technical roadmap and assist their teams. You will guide the other architects in the group and help coordinate work so that our architects and staff engineers are working on the highest priority issues.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Experience delivering products and services in one or more domains: large scale data analytics, highly available/fault tolerant systems, virtualized storage, distributed systems or operating systems
Experience developing with C++ and Java
AWS is building a new distributed query accelerator that provides the foundation for a next wave of performance improvement and innovation in cloud-based analytics. AQUA, Advanced Query Accelerator, was designed from the ground up to minimize unnecessary data movement by using large, high-speed caches, custom hardware, and by pushing reduction and aggregation computation closer to rapidly expanding analytics data. AQUA uses hardware acceleration to efficiently filter and aggregate data and minimize data transmission over the network by sending only the results. This new capability enables AWS Redshift to run up to 10x faster than any other cloud data warehouse. As data warehouses continue to grow over the next few years, the network bandwidth needed to move all this data becomes a bottleneck on query performance. AQUA takes a novel approach to cloud data warehousing, AQUA brings the compute to storage by doing a substantial share of data processing in-place on an innovative new query accelerator. In addition, it uses AWS-designed processors and a scale-out architecture to accelerate data processing beyond anything traditional CPUs can do.
We are looking for contributors in areas of storage, hardware-software abstraction and co-design, query processing, data and control plane development for multi-tenant, distributed systems, hardware design verification and database performance engineering to help us build this new technology and integrate into analytics platforms.

For this specific role we are looking for Software Development Manager who has a strong track record building successful products and services and grown high performance development teams. You will be responsible to build and grow a development team, to rethink assumptions behind how traditional data warehouse services are built, how to build database services best suited for the cloud with heterogenous hardware stack and integrating AQUA with data analytics services. You will provide leadership on complex and challenging technical and project issues. You are an expert in distributed, high performance computation, data processing or analytics. You should be passionate about optimizing the software development methodology at a very large scale, using your strong technical skills and motivation to achieve results in a fast-paced environment. You are naturally enthusiastic about learning new technologies and industry trends and are excited by the idea of enabling and guiding your team solving hard technical challenges.

Broad knowledge of customer analytics workloads and use cases, including performance, availability and scalability
PhD in EE/CS with 10+ years of industrial experience and 7+ years project and people management experience
Proven track record managing development and operation of complex projects in the areas of large scale data analytics, high performance computing, database kernel engineering, highly available/fault tolerant systems, replicated or virtualized data storage or compilers.

Your Opportunity
New Relic is looking for an experienced software engineer and technical leader to join our Instrumentation group as an architect. This group is responsible for all New Relic agents and service integrations which drive 150 billion data points per minute into the New Relic One platform.
If you’re ready for this job, you’ve spent years (decades?) designing and building high-availability, high-scale, production systems. You had plenty of front-line experience in the past, but now you’re more interested in how complex systems work together. You’ve made mistakes (probably lots of them) and learned from them, but you’ve also been a part of great successes.
Being an Architect at New Relic
At many companies, the Architects are gatekeepers and enforcers. They’re the people who tell you that your project violates the hosting policy or that you really shouldn’t design your system to generate and gain an HTTP request for every customer page load - but that’s just not our style here, we do things differently!
At New Relic, we expect our Architects to be leaders, not gatekeepers. Sure, sometimes a leader has to say no, but that isn’t really the heart of the job. A leader should lead. They paint the vision of where we’re going and make sure that everyone has what they need to get there.
We hire awesome engineers. If you can help them see into the future, make decisions that support each-other and avoid mistakes that will be expensive to fix later, those awesome engineers can deliver awesome results.
What your playground will look like
Linux, Docker, Kafka, Thrift, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript and Go...and that’s just the beginning!
A constantly evolving architecture, with hundreds of services across 60+ agile teams.
A hybrid data center/cloud environment accepting over 50 billion HTTP requests a day from our customers and scanning more than 150 billion data points each minute.
Most of our agents are now open source, so comfort working with an open source community is a major bonus.
What You’ll Do
We have a globally distributed development organization with teams spanning a nine-hour swath of timezones. The only way to keep all those teams in sync is to document as much as we can. Therefore, you need to be keen on clear and concise written communications.
You will help surface important issues and drive them to resolution.
As an architect, you will be working closely with our Instrumentation leadership team. They will be relying on you to help them formulate the technical roadmap and assist teams.
Often the difference between elegance and failure is how well you set the boundaries of components in a system. This is true for OOP and it’s true for microservices. You will use your judgment and experience to help teams define those interfaces.
Every week our engineers face new and interesting challenges. Because we’re always pushing the boundaries on scale, many of these are things we’ve never seen before. However, that doesn’t mean they’ve never been seen anywhere else before. Your job is to help the organization learn from the rest of the world.
Your Qualifications
Exceptional technical ability. Likely with 10+ years of experience as an engineer.
Experience in a wide range of languages and technologies. Ideally with depth in Java, streaming architectures, and high throughput systems.
Strong communication and collaboration skills. In particular listening skills and the ability to work effectively with every personality type.
Self-directed and self-managing working style.
Able to engineer anywhere on the spectrum from fast proof of concept work to careful contributions in risk-averse problem domains.
Strong operational experience. Ideally in a 24x7 SaaS environment.
Bonus qualifications: experience with Open Instrumentation and/or OpenTelemetry. Experience designing and working within an open-source community environment.
Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

Amazon Web Services is the market leader and technology forerunner in the Cloud business. As a member of the AWS Support team you will be at the forefront of this transformational technology, assisting a global list of companies and developers that are taking advantage of a growing set of services and features to run their mission-critical applications. As a Cloud Support Engineer, you will act as the ‘Cloud Ambassador’ across all the cloud products, arming our customers with required tools & tactics to get the most out of their Product and Support investment.

Would you like to use the latest cloud computing technologies? Do you have an interest in helping customers understand application architectures and integration approaches? Are you familiar with best practices for applications, servers and networks? Do you want to be part of a customer facing technology team helping to ensure the success of Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a leading technology organization?

If you fit the description, you might be the person we are looking for! We are a group of smart people, passionate about cloud computing, and believe that world class support is critical to customer success.

WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM A LIFE AT AWS?

Every day will bring new and exciting challenges on the job while you:

Learn and use groundbreaking technologies.
Apply advanced troubleshooting techniques to provide unique solutions to our customers' individual needs.
Interact with leading engineers around the world.
Partner with Amazon Web Services teams to help reproduce and resolve customer issues.
Leverage your extensive customer support experience to provide feedback to internal AWS teams on how to improve our services.
Drive customer communication during critical events.
Drive projects that improve support-related processes and our customers’ technical support experience.
Write tutorials, how-to videos, and other technical articles for the developer community.
Work on critical, highly complex customer problems that may span multiple AWS services.
WHY AWS SUPPORT?

First and foremost this is a customer support role – in The Cloud.
On a typical day, a Support Engineer will be primarily responsible for solving customer’s cases through a variety of customer contact channels which include telephone, email, and web/live chat. You will apply advanced troubleshooting techniques to provide tailored solutions for our customers and drive customer interactions by thoughtfully working with customers to dive deep into the root cause of an issue.
Apart from working on a broad spectrum of technical issues, an AWS Support Engineer may also coach/mentor new hires, develop & present training, partner with development teams on complex issues or contact deflection initiatives, participate in new hiring, write tools/script to help the team, or work with leadership on process improvement and strategic initiatives.
Career development: We promote advancement opportunities across the organization to help you meet your career goals.
Training: We have training programs to help you develop the skills required to be successful in your role.
We hire smart people who are keen to build a career with AWS, so we are more interested in the areas that you do know instead of those you haven’t been exposed to yet.
Support engineers interested in travel have presented training or participated in focused summits across our sites or at specific AWS events.
As we operate on a follow-the-sun model, with Premium Support sites located globally, there is no after hours on-call or mandated overtime in this role.
The DMS role supports AWS mobile technologies (Cognito, Device Farm, Pinpoint, etc) and Serverless technologies (Lambda, API Gateway, Step functions, etc). Mobile Services and Serverless Architectures are some of the fastest growing areas of technology and we're excited to help developers innovate and deliver amazing experiences.

Experience with System Administration with Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS, RedHat) and/or Microsoft Windows Server and associated technologies (Active Directory, Exchange).
Experience in Networking technologies including DNS, TCP/IP, SSL, DHCP and Load Balancing.
Experience with Network troubleshooting tools (telnet, test-netconnection, tracert, tracetcp, iperf, ntttcp, dig, and packet capture tools).
Experience with programming/scripting (Batch, VB, PowerShell, Java, C#, Chef, Perl, Ruby and/or PHP).
Strong analysis and troubleshooting skills and experience.
Experience managing full application stacks from the OS up through custom applications.
Exposure to Virtualization (Hyper-V, VMware, Xen).
Good understanding of distributed computing environments.

5+ years of professional experience in software development.
Professional experience with Python & SQL required.
A strong attention to detail and quality, especially as it applies to data.
You have a customer-oriented and empathetic mindset to understand how data can be used to empower end-users.

You demonstrate the ability to bring code from whiteboard scribbles to running in production.
You are passionate about working in a dynamic and growing startup environment with a tight-knit, supportive engineering team that strives to make work interesting, challenging and fun.
A constant desire for learning and self-improvement, and a desire to keep up with advancements in data engineering practices.
